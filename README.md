# Comparing-Text-Classification-Methods

This is a multi-class classification problem wherein using previous years' news headlines and their categories, a classifier is created to deal with unseen headlines. Both machine learning and deep learning techniques were used to achieve it and a comparison based on preprocessing required, training time, and validation metrics is presented. The data used can be found [<u>here (UCI News Aggregator)</u>](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/News+Aggregator).
